# Mira_internship_task_1
This project is a simple application that uses the Python Tkinter module to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying the current time and a stop watch. The project consists of two main components: a real time watch and a stop watch. 
The real time watch shows the current date and time in the format of DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS using the datetime module. 
The stop watch allows the user to start, stop, reset, and record the elapsed time in seconds using the time module. The GUI has four buttons: Start, Stop, Reset, and Lap. The Start button starts the stop watch and changes its text to Pause.
The Pause button pauses the stop watch and changes its text to Resume. 
The Reset button resets the stop watch to zero and clears the lap records.
The Lap button records the current elapsed time and displays it in a list below the stop watch. 
The GUI also has two labels: one for showing the real time watch and one for showing the stop watch. 
The labels have different fonts and colors to make them distinct. 
The project demonstrates how to use Tkinter widgets, such as buttons, labels, and frames, to create a simple but functional GUI application in Python.
